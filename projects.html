      <h2>ByteClass.io</h2>
      <p><a href="https://byteclass.io" target="_blank">ByteClass</a>, a project I'm spearheading in conjunction with my PGCE Secondary Computing studies, serves as an expansive repository of resources and insights curated from my experiences in programming lessons. The platform, meticulously crafted using the <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian </a> markdown program with the Publish functionality,</p>
      <p>The primary goal is to categorise resources into three distinct sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>General Resources: This section encompasses information on applications, programming languages, and general syntax—providing a comprehensive foundation for learners.</li>
        <li>Language-Specific Tasks: Featuring a curated collection of language-specific tasks and activities utilized in my lessons, this section serves as a practical resource for educators and learners alike.</li>
        <li>Computer Science Theory: A dedicated space for exploring computer science theory and additional resources, enhancing the overall learning experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As I continue to augment this site with valuable content, I am concurrently aligning it with another initiative called <a href="https://teachcs.io" target="_blank">TeachCS</a>. In collaboration with Dimitrios Nakos, a fellow Linux enthusiast and programmer, TeachCS is designed to deliver scenario-based programming activities tailored for learners aged 11-18.</p>
      <p>By interlinking these projects, I aim to create a synergistic learning ecosystem that not only consolidates programming knowledge but also offers engaging and practical experiences through <a href="https://teachcs.io" target="_blank">TeachCS</a>. Together, these initiatives strive to make programming education more accessible and enjoyable for a diverse range of learners.</p>

      <p><a href="https://teachcs.io" target="_blank">TeachCS</a> represents a collaborative side project that I'm currently developing with my good friend and fellow computer enthusiast, Dimitrios Nakos. Dimitrios, a neurobiology researcher based at the University of Athens, Greece, and I bring diverse experiences to the table—my background lies in control systems, building management, and embedded systems, while Dimitrios has leveraged Python and R programming extensively for biological data analysis.</p>
      <p>Our combined experiences span various environments, providing us with a rich array of scenarios where coding skills prove indispensable. This eclectic background serves as a solid foundation for the vision behind <a href="https://teachcs.io" target="_blank">TeachCS</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://teachcs.io" target="_blank">TeachCS</a> is a venture dedicated to crafting scenario-based projects tailored for teaching programming and computer science to students aged 11-18 in school settings. By drawing on our unique expertise, we aim to create engaging and relevant learning experiences that resonate with students' interests and real-world applications.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://teachcs.io" target="_blank">TeachCS</a> is still in its early stages of development, with time constraints stemming from my pursuit of PGCE/QTS qualifications, the project remains active. Individual scripts from our ongoing efforts are periodically released as part of the <a href="https://byteclass.io" target="_blank">ByteClass</a> project. This dual approach allows us to contribute valuable resources to the programming education community while ensuring the continued progress of <a href="https://teachcs.io" target="_blank">TeachCS</a>, even amid other commitments.</p>
