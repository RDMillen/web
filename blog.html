      <h2>3rd Feb 24</h2>
      <p>Moving into the last week of the first placement of the PGCE course, two assignments down and two to go. Starting to look for final documents to wrap up the first portion of the ePortfolio and wrap up end of term assessments. </p>
      <p>Feels odd, built a good repore with quite a lot of the students and feel somewhat responsible for the year 11s and 13s that will be sitting their exams in May, plus the A level programming project that I've been supporting for the past three months. Hopefully they'll come up trumps.</p>

        <p>This is the first post that will be going onto my new "from-scratch" website. The idea of this site is that it will act as a hybrid CV alongside collections of my thoughts and current projects relating to my work and interests.</p>
        <p>It has been a long while since I've properly worked with HTML and CSS but I am relatively happy with how this turned out, and of course the most time consuming aspect of the site creation was selecting the appropraite colours for each element.</p>
        <p>All source for this webpage is available through my <a href="https://github.com/RDMillen/Personal-Site" target="_blank">Github</a> for the perusal of those interested.</p>
